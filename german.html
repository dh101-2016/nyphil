    <h2>German Influence</h2>
    <p>The formative years of the New York Philharmonic are defined primarily by the success and tribulations of its early conductors. Developments in repertoire, programming, and the general culture of symphonic orchestra may be traced alongside personal relationships to European practices. The groundwork for what would later become the New York Philharmonic was laid alongside the rise of German immigration in the 19th century.

    <p>In the mid 1800s, New York found itself in the midst of an enormous shift in musical culture. German musicians-- primarily immigrants fleeing Germany following the collapse of the German Revolutions of 1848, had begun to oust English and American musicians from many prominent theatre orchestras. Immigration during this period jumped sharply, reaching its peak of nearly 1.5 million in the decade 1881-1890 and declining fiercely after the start of WWI. For nearly 70 years, German musicians dominated the culture of musical performance and symphonic orchestra. German, rather than American or English compositions, began to be played during intermissions and interludes of most performances, and German dominated as the primary language of most rehearsals (Martin). The wave of German immigrants in the 1840s would considerably reorient the American orchestra scene. This influx of German musicians was accompanied by a rise in German audiences. The 1840s featured programming of Sunday concerts, choral societies, and concerts held in beer gardens-- all rooted in German tradition (Spitzer).</p>
    <p>Within the New York Philharmonic, Germans made up nearly 40% of all musicians by 1848, increasing to 80% by 1875. By this time, Germans totaled to 30% of the general population of New York state. Every conductor within the NYP from 1852-1902 identified as of German or Austrian descent (Horowitz). After Prussia’s defeat of France in 1870, Otto von Bismarck’s leadership (1864-1870) called for the unification of diverse German states into one single, militaristic, absolutist monarchy. In the previous century, Frederick the Great of Prussia had played the flute and composed -- the new German Emperor, William I, had no interests in developing the arts and humanities. This political climate caused many musicians to set their sights elsewhere, conceding that no first rate musical organization could be created in Germany at this time (Martin). Until World War I, nearly 70% of the orchestra’s yearly repertoire consisted of works by German-Austrian composers (Horowitz). While all conductors of the New York Philharmonic contributed greatly to the development of the orchestra scene in America, the role of early German influence should be highlighted. </p></div></div>

    <p>Many notable early conductors all shared a firm connection to German musical processes-- either through interpersonal influence or by direct lineage. Carl Bergmann, Theodore Thomas, Leopold and Walter Damrosch, and Gustav Mahler are principal conductors noted for their contributions to the early rise of the New York Philharmonic, as well as their ties to German orchestra culture. The bar graph below is a general overview of early prominent conductors, representing the demographic breakdown of composers played by nationality. The second set of bar graphs hones in on each conductor, illuminating the individual composers played.</p></div></div>
