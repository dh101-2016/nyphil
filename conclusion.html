    <p>Between 1842 and 1911, the NY Philharmonic performed a total of 5,968 times within various venues across New York City. These venues, arranged from least to most performance instances, include Century Theatre (13), Castle Garden (22), Broadway Tabernacle (23), New York Theatre Roof (24), Chickering Hall (40), Brooklyn Academy of Music (65), New Theatre (130), Niblo’s Garden, 191, Steinway Hall (276), Apollo Rooms (303), Metropolitan Opera House (489), Academy of Music (1094), and Carnegie Hall (3298). The NY Phil venues were instrumental to the development of musical communities across the city.</p>
    <p>Before the construction of a claimed venue, the New York Philharmonic performed nomadically throughout the city of New York. Between 1856 and 1886, they performed primarily in the Academy of Music, a 4,000-person capacity opera house built in 1854. On October 3, 1854, the New York Times published a critical review of the venue, describing the viewing experience as follows: “It appears to have been the special device of the architect to keep every spectator as far from the stage as possible...in the Amphitheatre, we doubt if a thousand persons could, by any possibility, catch a glimpse of what was going on. A new system of placing the chairs might remedy this defect” (NY Times, 3 Oct 1854). The Academy of Music failed to facilitate an enjoyable viewing experience, disappointing audience members. In 1886, the Academy of Music burnt down, causing the Philharmonic to seek alternative venues. </p>
    <p>The Philharmonic found refuge in the Metropolitan Opera House, which opened its doors on October 22, 1883 and was designed by architect Josiah Cleaveland Cady. The Philharmonic transitioned to this new venue under the direction of conductor Theodore Thomas. The Metropolitan required more funds to hold performances (Martin). Moreover, conductors Theodore Thomas and Walter Damrosch criticized the venue’s oversized stage and poor acoustics for their esteemed musical performances (Peyser). </p>
    <p>The NY Phil and New York City as a whole, were in dire need for a music-centric performance space. Existing opera houses, theatres, and halls failed to satisfy the vision of the early leading conductors of New York City. Conductors Walter Damrosch and Theodore Thomas were disheartened by a proper music venue, proclaiming that such a space would drastically transform the value and experience of orchestral music in New York (Peyser). </p></div></div>
